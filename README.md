Currency Exchanger has been one of the best apps for calculating the currencies rates on Windows Store. But because Yahoo Finance stopped the data api since 2017, it couldn't work anymore. I didn't have enough time to maintain it so it was removed from the store. Now I would like to refactor the app as a Xamarin app so it will launch on Android, iOS and Windows. I hope I can finish it in 2019. I have also purchased the API for currency rates.

This app can easily calculate different currencies amount. My goal is making it to be the best currency rates app for all platforms.
